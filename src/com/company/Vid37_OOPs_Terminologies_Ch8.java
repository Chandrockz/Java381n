        * Inheritance --> An act of deriving new things from existing things
                         -e.g = manufacturing E-car from old combustion cars( i.e upgrading. wheels,basic design
                                remains same,only power-source changed) (No need to design whole new car from scratch)
                              = Inheritance implements DRY policy ( Do not Repeat Yourself )
        * Polymorphism --> One entity many forms.
                        -e.g = A smartphone can be used for -> making calls, camera, music player, calculator, etc
